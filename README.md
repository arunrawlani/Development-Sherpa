####Inspiration
My friend Steven was in New York City a month back. With New York’s rich culture and unique lifestyle, anyone would expect to have a good time. But Steven didn’t. Why? Not having a single friend in the city, he had no clue where to meet interesting people, where to discover the underground music scene, where to experience the true nature of New York?
Steven’s unfortunate suffering is something common nowadays. Truth is: travelling has lost its personal touch; by having no real connection with local cultures, it has become frustrating, boring, and generic. Knowing there must be a better way to travel, we created our app, Sherpa.

####How it works
Sherpa connects travelers in a new city with passionate locals who can take them on exciting and culturally flavored tours around the city in the their own native language. It is unique in that it focuses on travelling for experience & helps building a social dynamic amongst travelers around the world. Our target audiences are young domestic travellers and international travelers visiting the United States. Last year alone, 1.8 million Chinese tourists brought a whooping $21 billion cash flow into the United States’ tourism industry.
